# Exercise 6.3


Write a program that asks the user to enter positive integer numbers until either 10 numbers have been entered or a value of `q` is entered. 

Then the numbers entered should be displayed in reverse order.

**For simplicity do not worry about checking for valid input.**

Example runs would be:
```
Please enter the next number: 1
Please enter the next number: 5
Please enter the next number: 6
Please enter the next number: 10
Please enter the next number: q
The reverse of the numbers entered is:
10
6
5
1
```

```
Please enter the next number: 1
Please enter the next number: 2
Please enter the next number: 3
Please enter the next number: 4
Please enter the next number: 5
Please enter the next number: 6
Please enter the next number: 7
Please enter the next number: 8
Please enter the next number: 9
Please enter the next number: 10
The reverse of the numbers entered is:
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```
Your program shouldn't output anything if the user enters ``q``.
```
Please enter the next number: q
No numbers entered.
```



You should write your code in the ``main()`` function.

Copy the following code into **main.py**.

```python
def main():
    pass

# This is the entry point of the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() # call the main function
```
